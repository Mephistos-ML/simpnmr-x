# SimpNMR-X

> **SimpNMR-X** is an independently maintained research and engineering fork of [SimpNMR](https://gitlab.com/suturina-group/simpnmr), developed by Ernest Borysenko as part of his PhD research. It has its own release cycle and engineering direction, with particular emphasis on stable pipelines, reproducible validation, and maintainable architecture. Mature, broadly useful changes may later be adapted and contributed upstream to SimpNMR.

**SimpNMR-X** is an open-source Python toolkit for prediction, fitting, and analysis of paramagnetic NMR spectra using experimental measurements and ab initio calculations. It provides a focused, reproducible environment for developing dependable workflows and validating new pNMR methods.

## Features

- Prediction of paramagnetic NMR shifts and spectra
- Susceptibility tensor fitting from experimental measurements
- Integration with quantum-chemistry outputs, including ORCA and Gaussian
- Experimental fitting and inference workflows
- Reproducible synthetic validation and acceptance testing
- Research-oriented development of new pNMR analysis methods

## Project relationship and authorship

SimpNMR-X complements SimpNMR. SimpNMR remains the upstream project for the shared scientific lineage and established citation record. Ernest Borysenko also contributes to the ongoing development and maintenance of SimpNMR, allowing mature work from this repository to be aligned with the upstream project where appropriate.

All original architecture, pipeline design, testing infrastructure, and engineering direction introduced in this fork are authored and maintained by Ernest Borysenko. This repository provides a focused and reproducible record of that work while remaining connected to the broader SimpNMR ecosystem.

## Installation

```bash
pip install simpnmr-x
simpnmr-x --help
```

SimpNMR-X requires Python 3.10 or newer.

The supported baseline is verified in CI on Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

## Quick example

```bash
simpnmr-x predict input.yml
```

## Demonstration

The P3FeCl example runs a complete prediction workflow from quantum-chemistry
outputs and produces a simulated-versus-experimental 13C spectrum:

```bash
cd examples/P3FeCl/SIMULATIONS/Prediction
simpnmr-x --hide predict P3FeCl_Prediction.yml
```

The generated figures and tabular results are written to
`P3FeCl_13C_Prediction/`.
